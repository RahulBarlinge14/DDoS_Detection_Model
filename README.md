# DDoS Attack Detection Model - HKRE

## Overview

This project presents the **HKRE (Hybridized KNN and Random Forest with Ensemble Learning)** model, an innovative solution for detecting Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in cloud environments. By combining the strengths of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest algorithms through ensemble learning techniques, HKRE offers enhanced accuracy and speed, ensuring minimal disruption to service availability.

## Features

- **Hybrid Model**: Combines KNN and Random Forest with ensemble learning to improve DDoS detection accuracy.
- **High Efficiency**: Achieves high detection accuracy with fast execution times.
- **Scalability**: Seamlessly integrates with cloud monitoring services for efficient resource management and scalability.
- **Adaptability**: Fine-tuned model parameters allow for dynamic adaptation to changing network conditions.

## Installation

To set up the DDoS attack detection model:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RahulBarlinge14/DDoS_Detection_Model.git
   cd DDoS_Detection_Model
